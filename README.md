## About This Repository

Right now, this repository is a starting point for my journey in data science and machine learning. It contains simple Python scripts and will eventually include more advanced projects, notebooks, and data analysis examples as I learn more.

Feel free to follow along as I develop projects and add content. Iâ€™ll be focusing on topics like:

- Python Programming
- Data Analysis with Pandas
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Machine Learning Basics with Scikit-Learn
